Differences from brightspace submission and assesment:

-Added obscure text for password when login and register
-Change the input of location to be a selection of premade dropdown options instead of plain text
-About Us Page: added tap gesture for phone number, redirecting to phone app with number dialled
-About Us Page: added tap gesture for email, displaying dialogbox to send message. Upon sending, will be redirected to email app with the email drafted, but must be logged in on gmail app.
